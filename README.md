## Overview
This project aims to develop evaluation matrices for comparing point clouds generated by different methods. The evaluation matrices will provide quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the accuracy, completeness, and fidelity of point cloud representations.

## Features
- Quantitative evaluation metrics: Developed algorithms to compute quantitative metrics such as Hausdorff distance, mean squared error, and point cloud density.
- Data visualization: Implemented tools for visualizing point clouds and evaluation results to facilitate analysis and interpretation.
- Documentation: Provided comprehensive documentation for the evaluation matrices, including usage instructions, algorithm descriptions, and examples.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: 

```git clone https://gitlab.bht-berlin.de/s87298/masterprojekt/```

2. Install dependencies:

```pip install -r req.yaml```

Ensure you have Python installed in a version >= 3.6 and < 3.10.

3. Run the evaluation scripts: 

```python app.py -scene <scene name> -scale <scale> -error <error>```

4. Run the visualization script:

```python .\show_plot.py <scene name> <model name>```
